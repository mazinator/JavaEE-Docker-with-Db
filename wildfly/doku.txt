Wildfly doku:
https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/wildfly/

Command doku:
#!/bin/bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/deployments:/opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/ jboss/wildfly

"-p 7070:8080" map host port 7070 to guest port 8080 (now you could access the wildfly for example over localhost:7070)

"-v $PWD/deployments:/opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/" map the host directory at $PWD/deployments to the guest directory /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployements/"
    there has to be a slash at the end (see wildlfy doku)
    $PWD is the current working directory (run_wildfly.sh has to be executed in the directory it is in; $PWD happens in the shell and has nothing to do with docker) 
    so on my machine docker will see:
        -v /home/robin/Desktop/Windows Desktop/Schule/NVS_GIT_STUETZ/docker_mazanek/wildfly/deployments:/opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/

"jboss/wildfly" wildfly image name



access example with URL: http://localhost:8080/restprimer/rs/time
